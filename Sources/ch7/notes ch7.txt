the calculator revamped is a very good representation of how an
initially thought "over" project can then be updated with not only new features,
but also applying some code cleaning and comments.

Thus, have a look at all the commits with the things added and the ones changed
to learn and get an idea of how to clean and better the code everytime there's the need.
